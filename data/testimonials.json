    "testimonial": "Met Cameron and the team in January. Everyone has been fully behind me since day one and really helped me to achieve my original goals of losing weight and getting fitter. The service does not end there though as they have also provided me lots of invaluable knowledge and habits that will keep in good health long into the future. I can not recommend them highly enough. Totally professional and so knowledgeable. If you commit to their programme, then you can’t fail to be rewarded personally."

    "testimonial": "Cameron and his team have a strong knowledge in both fitness and nutrition. I recently completed the 6 week fitness challenge, and have lost just over 8kg. IT WORKS. The accountability is key. The flexibility of remote PT sessions helps you work around your diary on an adhoc basis, which really helps as we have a young kid at home and work hours can change day to day. If you go ahead with the 6 week programme and buy into the nutrition and fitness you will get results, 100%."

    "testimonial": "17 weeks post full knee replacement I wasn’t sure how to make better progress beyond physio appointments and my own attempts at a gym programme. I had a partial knee replacement on the other knee 6 years ago and years of trying to keep weight down, improve muscle strength, give time to my busy career and spend time with family felt tough at times. Cam listened, truly listened, and told me he and his team could definitely make a difference. And quickly. I met Craig and with his expertise in nutrition, his planning of a bespoke gym programme and his genuine support, I haven’t looked back. 10 days in to a 6 week rapid result programme and I’m sleeping better, gym workouts are delivering real strength benefits, pain is easing, eating better and in a week I’ve lost 9lbs. My life is still busy but I now feel happier, more confident in my post op progress and healthier. I cannot wait to see what the next few weeks bring, and then beyond. It’s the best investment I’ve made in me in a long time. And I’m so pleased I’ve done it with Truth Fitness. No more excuses. Just doing it."

    "testimonial": "As a Founder and CEO of 2 companies, when I first reached out to Cameron and his team at TRUTH, I was dubious about how I would fit the Rapid Result System into my very busy daily schedule. I'm pleased to be able to say that my concerns were totally unfounded. The team was excellent, really flexible and the coaching worked around my diary. As a result, I feel much healthier and fitter than I have been in the past 25yrs, so big thank you to the TRUTH team and long may it continue."

It seems like the only thing in my life I can't absolutely crush on my own. Partnering with Cameron and Tony has been really impactful for me, and I'm happy to be able to recommend my executive coaching clients to them for activating their fitness and nutrition goals."

    "testimonial": "I have been training with the guys at Truth for a couple of years now. What first impressed me was they took time to understand what I was looking to achieve, a bit different from when I first used personal trainers now that I am mid ‘50’s, and built a program focused on being structurally strong alongside nutrition advice. They have adapted well to a virtual offering since early 2020, providing flexibility and a range of coaches, to fit in with a busy work life. I can definitely say I feel healthier today than I would do without their support."
